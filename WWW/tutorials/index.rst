Estimating Reliability with Linear Models
-------------------
he goal of this tutorial is to provide a better intuition about the intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's $\alpha$ as measures of reliability.
Specifically, we will give an example of ratings from two raters (per sample)
that are correlated across samples, but not necessarily the most reliable.
We'll show how estimates of reliability can be calculated using
**1- and 2-way models** with either **random effects**, or **mixed effects**.
