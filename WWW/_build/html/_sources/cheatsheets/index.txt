Calculating Cohen's :math:`\kappa` by hand
----------------------------

This PDF provides the equations to calculate Cohen's :math:`\kappa`, a measure of 
reliability for qualitative data, by hand. In other words, this is a measure of 
agreement corrected for chance. This example assumes that 2 raters provided 
ratings for whether or not the category "family" was present in a written narrative 
(i.e., ratings of "yes" or "no"). There were 43 narratives in total.

Math behind Chi Square tests
----------------------------

This PDF provides the math to run chi-square tests by hand. It includes both a
one-way classification (i.e., a goodness-of-fit test) and 2 way classification
(i.e., a contingency test, or test of independence).

Model Comparison Guidelines
---------------------------

Guide for comparing mixed effects models (and fixed effects models), adapted from Paul's guide; 
how to determine whether to use ML or REML when fitting your model; comparing models based on 
deviance, or using AIC.
